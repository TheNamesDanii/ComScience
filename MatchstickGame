3 is a losing position as I have to take the first matchstick or the first two matchsticks, then the opposite player may take the last two or last matchstick and win the game.

(ii)
4 is a winning position as I can take one matchstick, the other player can take two, then I take the last one. Another way is I take one, they take one, I take two. I win!

(iii)
5 matchsticks remaining
Me | Other | Remaining
1  |  1    | 3
1  |  1    | 1
1  |  0    | 0 = I take the last one. I win!

Verdict = Winning Position!

6 matchsticks remaining
Me | Other | Remaining
1  | 1     |  4
1  | 2     |  1
1  | 0     |  0 = I take the last one. I win!

Verdict = Winning Position!

(iv)
I would choose to go second as one the other player would make their move and I would be able to see how many matchsticks are remaining and plot my remaining moves from there, for example taking away one or two matchsticks.

(v)
I would recommend taking two matchsticks if the number of remaining matchsticks is odd as it increases the chances of me pulling the last matchstick at the end of the game.

(b) (ii)
Based on the diagram, taking one from pile Y is best as no matter what move the other player takes, player A can always take the last matchstick from either pile and win the game.

(iii)
Take one from pile X, making the score (1, 3). The other player takes all the matchsticks from pile Y, making it (1,0). Then take the last matchstick from pile X to win the game.

(iv)
A winning strategy is to just take one stick at a time from alternating piles to make the other player take the second last stick, therefore taking the last stick and winning.

(v)
The number of sticks in all of the piles is the same therefore using the same strategy as before will guarantee a win as the other player will have to take the second last stick from the second last pile and therefore
put the win into my hands.

(c)
I have thought of pattern recognition as I have noticed a pattern when it comes to how the end of the game plays out if I were to take one stick at a time, not two or three. If I take just one on my turn,
I almost always am able to take the last stick and win the game.
